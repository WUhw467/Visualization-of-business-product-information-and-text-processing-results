The python file is too big to upload to the github, so please download the zip file for the python code.

Please go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gS6DtMmMJ0SQLt6WeXzaRHpGtF94Zo7A?usp=sharing to download the datasets.

There is a train.tsv file and a test.tsv file. Both of them contain the information about the products and this project will mainly focus on the train.tsv.

The train dataset contain 1482535 rows and 8 columns. These variables are train_id, name, item_condition_id, category_name, brand_name, price, shipping, and item_description.

The project will analyze the business product information and visualize the analysis results and text processing results.
